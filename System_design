System Design: Basketball Real-Time Statistic Application

System Architecture: attached a System_Design_diagram.drawio designed in draw.io
Modules description:
1)	Frontend (User Interface):
User's Browser or App
Real-Time Data Display
Historical Data Display
2)	Backend:
Application Server(s) - Where the main application logic resides.
Real-Time Data Server (like WebSocket) - For pushing real-time updates to the frontend.
Database Server - Stores historical game data.
3)	Database:
Real-Time Game Data Table
Historical Game Data Table
User Data Table (if there are user accounts/profiles)
4)	External Services:
Perhaps integrating with third-party services to get some of the game data or other functionalities.
5)	Infrastructure:
Load Balancer - Directs incoming traffic to multiple application servers to balance the load.
Cache - For faster retrieval of frequently accessed data.

Description of Approach:
The system design focuses on delivering real-time basketball game statistics to users. It integrates various microservices, cloud solutions, and real-time data streaming to ensure efficiency, scalability, and reliability.
1. What technologies would your system leverage?
1)	Cloud Infrastructure (AWS or Azure): Leverage cloud services for flexibility and scalability. Using EC2 instances or Azure VMs to host the application backend. AWS RDS or Azure SQL can be used for relational data storage.

2)	Docker & Kubernetes: Containerization using Docker ensures that the application is consistent across various environments. Kubernetes provides automated deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers.

3)	WebSockets: For delivering real-time updates to the client. WebSocket provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

4)	Redis: An in-memory data structure store that can be used as a cache to speed up data retrieval and reduce database load.

5)	Nginx or HAProxy: For load balancing, ensuring that user requests are distributed across multiple servers.

6)	CDN (Content Delivery Network): To cache and distribute content closer to the user's location, ensuring faster load times and reducing the load on the primary server.

7)	Elasticsearch: For storing, searching, and analyzing large volumes of data quickly and in near real-time.

2. What issues might your system have if the application was to be accessed by 10,000 users simultaneously?
1)	Scalability: While our design caters to 100 simultaneous users, a sudden influx of 10,000 users may overwhelm the system if auto-scaling solutions aren't adequately set up. The database could become a bottleneck, and the application servers might be unable to handle the traffic, leading to increased response times or crashes.

2)	Database Load: The read and write operations could increase exponentially. Even with caching solutions like Redis, the primary database may still face issues with locking, leading to delayed data retrieval.

3)	Real-time Data Delay: With an increase in users, ensuring real-time data delivery might become challenging. WebSocket connections could be dropped, or data might be delivered with a slight delay.

4)	Cost: Auto-scaling to accommodate 10,000 users will increase the cost. More instances would be spawned, leading to higher operational costs.

5)	Load Balancer Overload: If not correctly configured, the load balancer might become a single point of failure, unable to distribute incoming traffic efficiently.

6)	Data Consistency: As data is being read from and written to the database in real-time, ensuring data consistency across all users can become a challenge.

7)	Security: With more users, the potential risk of DDOS attacks or other malicious activities increases. Ensuring security becomes paramount.

In conclusion, while the proposed architecture is robust and efficient for the intended audience size, addressing the challenges of scaling to 10,000 users would require further enhancements. Implementing a more distributed system, utilizing database sharding, and enhancing real-time data streaming mechanisms would be crucial steps in accommodating such a large user base.
